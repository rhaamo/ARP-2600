# Notes
## All panel jacks
- check if they are properly labelled/wired

## Original schematics
- The jacks have S and T, S represent SHUNT, T for TIP, and the circle seems the SLEEVE
- an UP arrow is +15V, a DOWN arrow is -15V

## Patroche reverse
- Some typos presents, missing items in BOM, and some components are mislabelled in the PCB placement pictures
